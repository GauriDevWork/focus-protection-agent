# Developer Focus Protection Agent (DFPA)

Developer Focus Protection Agent is an intelligent, developer-first tool designed to protect deep focus during software development.

It observes development signals such as context switching, cognitive overload, and interruption patterns, and intervenes minimally and respectfully to help developers maintain clarity and momentum.

## What This Tool Is
- A focus guardian for developers
- A cognitive load early-warning system
- A calm, context-aware assistant inside the development workflow

## What This Tool Is Not
- Not a productivity tracker
- Not a time-tracking tool
- Not employee monitoring software
- Not a performance scoring system

## Core Philosophy
- Focus is fragile
- Silence is often the best UX
- Developers are adults
- Tools should adapt to humans, not the other way around

## Current Status
 Early development (Week-long build sprint)

## Planned Platform
- VS Code Extension (V1)
- Local-first processing
- Privacy-respecting by default

## Roadmap
See `/docs` for product concepts, scope definitions, and design decisions.
