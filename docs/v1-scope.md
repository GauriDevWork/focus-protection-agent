# DFPA – V1 Scope

## Purpose
Protect developer focus by detecting early signals of distraction and
cognitive overload, including external communication interruptions.

## Platform
- VS Code Extension
- Local-first execution

## Signals Included
- Rapid file switching
- Low net progress over time
- Undo / redo hesitation loops
- Deep nesting growth
- Extended uninterrupted focus duration
- Basecamp notification events (metadata only)

## Allowed Interventions
- Suggest short focus lock
- Suggest pause-and-reflect moment
- Suggest bookmarking code for later refactor
- Suggest short break after extended focus
- Show post-focus interruption summary

## Intervention Rules
- One-line messages only
- Fully dismissible
- No repeated nagging
- Neutral, non-judgmental tone

V1 is intentionally small and restrained.
