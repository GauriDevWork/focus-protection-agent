# DFPA – Non-Goals (V1)

DFPA V1 explicitly does NOT do the following:

- No productivity scoring
- No time tracking
- No employee or team monitoring
- No manager dashboards
- No reading Basecamp message content
- No classifying messages as urgent or non-urgent
- No automatic muting or sending of messages
- No cloud dependency by default
- No behavioral or psychological profiling

DFPA prioritizes trust, autonomy, and developer well-being.
