# DFPA – Focus Signals (V1)

DFPA V1 detects observable, non-invasive signals that indicate loss of focus
or rising cognitive load. These signals are probabilistic indicators, not judgments.

## 1. Rapid File Switching
- Frequent file changes within a short time window
- Indicates context thrashing or interruption-driven navigation

## 2. Low Net Progress Over Time
- Long editing sessions with minimal net code diff
- Indicates uncertainty, being stuck, or overthinking

## 3. Undo / Redo Hesitation Loops
- High frequency of undo/redo actions in the same file
- Indicates fragile understanding or decision paralysis

## 4. Deep Nesting Growth
- Increasing nesting depth and function complexity
- Indicates cognitive load accumulation

## 5. Extended Focus Duration
- Long uninterrupted work sessions without breaks
- Indicates fatigue risk, even during productive flow

## 6. External Interruption Signals (Basecamp)
- Detection of Basecamp notification events (metadata only)
- Used only as a confidence modifier, never as a standalone trigger

DFPA surfaces awareness. It does not diagnose behavior.
